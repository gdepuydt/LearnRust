# Packages and Crates


    - A crate is a binary or library.
    - The crate root is a source file that is used to know how to build a crate.
    - A package has a Cargo.toml that describes how to build one or more crates. At most one crate in a package can be a library.

## The module system

Modules let us organize code into groups.

```rust
mod sound {
    pub mod instrument {
        pub fn clarinet() {
            // Function body code goes here
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::sound::instrument::clarinet();

    // Relative path
    sound::instrument::clarinet();
}
```

You can start relative paths with the `super` keyword, this is the `../` in a filesystem.

```rust
mod sound {
    mod instrument {
        fn clarinet() {
            super::breathe_in();
        }
    }

    fn breathe_in() {
        // Function body code goes here
    }
}
```

note: pub structs in a module still has private fields by default, you need to pub all of them individually.
When you pub an enum, however, all its fields are also pub by default.

The Ã¹se`keyword brings Paths into scope:

```rust
mod sound {
    pub mod instrument {
        pub fn clarinet() {
            // Function body code goes here
        }
    }
}

use crate::sound::instrument;
// use self::sound::instrument; with relative path you have to start it with `self`

fn main() {
    instrument::clarinet();
    instrument::clarinet();
    instrument::clarinet();
}
```

Rename types brought into scope:
`use std::io::Result as IoResult;`

Some scope tips&tricks:

```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// ---snip---

//or:
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};

////////////

use std::io;
use std::io::Write;

//or:

use std::io::{self, Write};

//Bring all public definitions into scope:

use std::collections::*;

```

## separating modules into different files

```rust
mod sound; // src/sound.rs

fn main() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::sound::instrument::clarinet();

    // Relative path
    sound::instrument::clarinet();
}
```

file src/sound/instrument.rs

The filetree must follows the logical module hierarchy.
